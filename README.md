<b>Codecademy Front-end Career Path | The Box Model module
Davie's Burgers project</b>
https://romahawk.github.io/Davie-s_Burgers/

In this project, I followed step-by-step instructions to fix a fictional restaurantâ€™s website. 
All of the HTML and most of the CSS were intact, but the box model properties had yet to be set. 
I used knowledge of height, width, padding, border, and margin to complete this project.
